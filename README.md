## Reference
* Find the original description here: [Guy Royse Vending Machine Kata](https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata)
* This kata shall be used to exercise stateful core business logic and
test driven development ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development?wprov=sfti1)). It is not about data storage nor user interfaces.
* I use `pytest` for testing. I recommend to work with a virtual
environment. Requirements for the test are these libraries: `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.
* The code is based on `python 3.14`.
