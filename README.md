* This kata shall be used to exercise finite state logic and
test driven development ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development?wprov=sfti1)).
* I use `pytest` for testing. I recommend to work with a virtual
environment. Requirements for the test are these libraries: `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.
* The code is based on `python 3.14`.
